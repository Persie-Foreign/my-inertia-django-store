                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
                        <li>Return requests should be done within 14 days from the day of arrival.</li>
                        <li>The items must be sealed, unused, and in the same condition that you received them.</li>
                        <li>Any gifts that were given for free should be included as well.</li>
                        <li>You must inform the customer service about the return in advance, and receive confirmation.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        To start a return, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:help@anua.us" className="underline text-blue-600">help@anua.us</a>.
                        If your return is accepted, we’ll send you a return shipping label, as well as instructions on how and where to send your package.
                        Items sent back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted.
                    </p>

                    <p>The return process is as follows:</p>
                    <ul className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1">
                        <li>Once you reach out to the customer service team regarding the return, you will receive a return label via e-mail. (Customer service email: help@anua.us)</li>
                        <li>Please print out and bring the return label to the USPS center, where you will submit the returning package. (You can print the return label at their center as well).</li>
                        <li>The refund will be processed once the package is returned and inspected by our warehouse, and they have confirmed that there are no issues found.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If the return is based on change of mind (ex. no longer need, not expected product), the customer is responsible for the round shipping fee:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Orders under $60:</strong> The value corresponding to the return label will be excluded from the refund, and so will the first standard shipping fee that you paid when placing the order.</li>
                        <li><strong>Orders over $60:</strong> The value corresponding to the return label will be excluded from the refund, and so will the first standard shipping fee that you were not charged, for receiving free shipping.</li>
                        <li><strong>Partial returns:</strong> The customer will be responsible for the return shipping fee of $6.99 (variable depending on the region).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Please read the regulations carefully and contact our customer service regarding the return.</p>
